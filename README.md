## Fall-Down-Detection


### Dataset
<br> [UR Fall Detection Dataset](http://fenix.ur.edu.pl/~mkepski/ds/uf.html):Michal KÄ™pski, Interdisciplinary Centre for Computational Modelling, University of Rzeszow
<br> [Multiple cameras fall dataset](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~labimage/Dataset/): This dataset contain 24 scenarios recorded with 8 IP video cameras. The first 22 first scenarios contain a fall and confounding events, the last 2 ones contain only confounding events.
<br> [Video Datasets](http://videodatasets.org/): This web site contains links to a number of video datasets used for computer vision research and created over a number of years by teams working with/in collaboration with  Prof. Sergio A Velastin, professor of Applied Computer Vision, recently a UC3M-Conex Marie Curie Research Professor at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Research Group, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain) and former director of the Digital Imaging Research Centre (Kingston University London, UK). He is now Visiting Professor at Queen Mary University of London, UK and at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain
